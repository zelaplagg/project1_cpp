# Student Records Management System (C++)

## Overview
This is a C++ application designed to manage student records using custom data structures. The project demonstrates a solid understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), dynamic memory management, and efficient data handling through a Priority Queue implementation.

Developed as a practical project during my studies at **Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute**.

## Key Features
* **Priority Queue Implementation:** Efficiently manages student records based on specific criteria.
* **CRUD Operations:** Full support for adding, viewing, and managing student data.
* **Dynamic Memory Management:** Manual handling of pointers and memory allocation to ensure performance.
* **Formatted Console UI:** Clean and intuitive command-line interface for data interaction.

## Technical Stack
* **Language:** C++ (Standard Template Library)
* **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* **Tools:** GCC/Clang compiler

## Project Structure
* `Student.cpp / .h` - Defines the Student entity and its attributes.
* `Queue.cpp / .h` - Custom implementation of the queue logic.
* `Main.cpp` - Entry point and user interface logic.

## How to Build and Run
1. **Clone the repository:**
